Expectations

Treat this exercise as if it was a task you were implementing as part of a normal working day. In your submission you are expected to include everything you would commit to source control before signing off the task as production ready.

  No database or UI is required
  You can assume the code will only ever be executed in a single threaded environment
  Minimise the number of external jar dependencies your code has. We would expect a maximum of one or two would be required.
  All data to be in memory.
  Output format to be plain text, printed out to the console.
  Create more sample data as needed.
  We would expect you to spend somewhere in the region of about 3 hours on this exercise.
  
The problem:

Sample data represents the instructions sent by various clients to JP Morgan to execute in the international market.

A work week starts Monday and ends Friday, unless the currency of the trade is AED or SAR, where the work week starts Sunday and ends Thursday. No other holidays to be taken into account.
A trade can only be settled on a working day.
If an instructed settlement date falls on a weekend, then the settlement date should be changed to the next working day.
USD amount of a trade = Price per unit * Units * Agreed Fx

Requirements:
